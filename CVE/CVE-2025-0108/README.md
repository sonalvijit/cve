# CVE-2025-0108 (Simulated) - Flask Authentication Bypass Demo

This repository demonstrates a simulated version of **CVE-2025-0108**, an authentication bypass vulnerability via improper path handling.

> ⚠️ **This simulation is for educational purposes only. Do not use this on unauthorized systems.**

---

## 💡 Overview

CVE-2025-0108 involves:
- Misconfigured path handling between Nginx and Apache.
- Authentication bypass via encoded paths like `/admin%2f..%2fadmin`.

This simulation uses Python Flask to mimic the behavior.

---

## 🧪 Components

### 1. `app.py` — Vulnerable Flask Web App

- Simulates a protected `/admin` route.
- Contains a vulnerable handler that processes malformed paths allowing bypass.

### 2. `exploit_poc.py` — Exploit Script

- Sends a normal request to `/admin` → gets redirected to login.
- Sends a bypass request to `/admin/..%2Fadmin` → successfully bypasses protection.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Step 1: Start the Flask App

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:3400/admin` in your browser.

### Step 2: Run the Exploit Script

```bash
python exploit_poc.py
```

You should see output indicating whether the exploit was successful.

---

## 🛡️ Prevention

- Normalize and sanitize all request paths.
- Avoid relying on URL structure alone for auth logic.
- Place authentication logic **inside** every handler.
