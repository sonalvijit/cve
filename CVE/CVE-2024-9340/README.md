# Flask DoS Simulation

This project demonstrates a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in a Flask application. The application is designed to simulate a scenario where improper handling of multipart form-data boundaries can lead to an infinite loop.

## Project Structure

```
docker-compose.yml      # Docker Compose configuration for running the Flask app
Dockerfile              # Dockerfile for building the Flask app container
vuln_app.py             # Vulnerable Flask application
exploit.py              # Exploit script to demonstrate the DoS vulnerability
.vscode/settings.json   # VS Code settings
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Python 3.11 or later (if running the exploit script locally)

## Usage

### Step 1: Build and Run the Flask Application

1. Build and start the Flask application using Docker Compose:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Step 2: Run the Exploit Script

1. Install the required Python dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```

2. Run the exploit script to simulate the DoS attack:

   ```sh
   python exploit.py
   ```

3. Observe the response in the terminal. The exploit script sends a malformed multipart form-data request to the `/upload` endpoint, triggering an infinite loop in the Flask application.

### Step 3: Stop the Application

To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running Docker Compose, then remove the containers:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

## Files

### `vuln_app.py`

This file contains the vulnerable Flask application. The `/upload` endpoint improperly handles multipart form-data boundaries, leading to an infinite loop when a specific boundary is provided.

### `exploit.py`

This script demonstrates the DoS vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the `/upload` endpoint.

### `Dockerfile`

The Dockerfile sets up the environment for running the Flask application.

### `docker-compose.yml`

This file defines the Docker Compose configuration for running the Flask application.
