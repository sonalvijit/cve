# Flask Notes App (XSS Vulnerable Version)

This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to add and view notes. It is intentionally vulnerable to **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** for educational and security testing purposes.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is intended **only for educational use** in controlled environments. Do **NOT** deploy this to a production environment.

## 🛠 Features

- Add a note via a form (`/add`)
- View all notes on the homepage (`/`)
- Uses SQLite for storage

## 💣 Vulnerability

The application includes an intentional vulnerability:

### Stored XSS

In `templates/index.html`, user input is rendered using the Jinja2 `|safe` filter, allowing unescaped HTML/JavaScript.

#### Example Payload:
```
<script>alert('XSS Test')</script>
```

## 🧪 Setup & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourname/flask-xss-notes.git
cd flask-xss-notes

# Create virtual environment and activate (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Flask
pip install Flask

# Run the app
python app.py
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.

```

## 🔐 How to Fix

To prevent XSS:
- Remove `|safe` filter in Jinja2 templates.
- Use libraries like `bleach` to sanitize user input.
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
