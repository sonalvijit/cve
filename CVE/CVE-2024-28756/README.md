# Flask Header Bypass Demo (`CVE-28756` Simulation)

This project demonstrates a simple Flask application with an insecure authorization mechanism that can be bypassed using a custom HTTP header. It is intended for educational and testing purposes only.

## 🚀 Overview

The app exposes a `/dashboard` route that checks for a bearer token in the `Authorization` header. If the token is incorrect or missing, access can still be granted if a special `X-Spoof` header is present.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── app.py                 # Flask application
├── attack.py              # Simulated attack script
├── Dockerfile             # Docker setup for the Flask app
├── docker-compose.yml     # Docker Compose for easy deployment
└── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
```

## 🧪 Example Behavior

- ✅ Correct Authorization:
  ```http
  Authorization: Bearer secrest123
  ```

- 🔓 Bypass Authorization:
  ```http
  X-Spoof: bypass
  ```

- ❌ Unauthorized:
  No header or incorrect token without spoof header

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/cve28756-demo.git
cd cve28756-demo
```

### 2. Install Requirements (Locally)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 3. Run with Docker
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the app at [http://localhost:5000/dashboard](http://localhost:5000/dashboard)

## 🛡️ Simulate the Attack

Run the attack script:
```bash
python attack.py
```

Expected Output:
```
Response: 200
Body: {"status":"Bypass successful, access granted!"}
```

## 📌 Notes

- This app is intentionally vulnerable and should **not** be used in production.
- The bypass logic is for demonstration purposes and mimics weak authorization checks.
