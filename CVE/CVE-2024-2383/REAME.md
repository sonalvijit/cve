# ZenML Dashboard Vulnerable App

This project demonstrates a **clickjacking vulnerability** in a Flask application. The application lacks proper security headers, making it susceptible to being embedded in malicious iframes.

---

## 📌 Summary

The application simulates a ZenML Dashboard with a "Delete My Account" button. Due to the absence of security headers like `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy`, attackers can embed this app in an iframe and trick users into performing unintended actions.
