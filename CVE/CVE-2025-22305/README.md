# CVE-2025-22305 - Local File Inclusion in Flask App (Educational)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability similar to CVE-2025-22305 using a Python Flask web application.

**⚠️ This is for educational purposes only. Do not use this in production.**

## Description

The Flask app lets users view text files by specifying the filename via a query parameter. However, it does not validate or sanitize the user input, allowing for path traversal and file inclusion.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Access a valid file:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/view?file=note1.txt
   ```

3. Exploit with path traversal:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/view?file=../../app.py
   ```

## Mitigation

- Sanitize and validate user inputs.
- Restrict file access using whitelists.
- Avoid using user input directly in file paths.
