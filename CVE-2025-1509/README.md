## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

### 2️⃣ Build and Start the Environment

Run the following commands to set up the WordPress environment:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The WordPress site will be available at: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### 3️⃣ Log in to WordPress

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/wp-admin](http://localhost:8080/wp-admin).
2. Use the following:
   - **Username:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `password` (or set during WordPress setup).

## 💣 Exploiting the Vulnerability

To exploit the vulnerability, append the `smc` parameter to the URL with arbitrary content. For example:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/?smc=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

This will execute the shortcode and display the content of the `smc` parameter.

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation

To fix the vulnerability, add proper validation and authentication checks before executing the shortcode. For example:

```php
add_action('init', function() {
    if (isset($_GET['smc']) && current_user_can('manage_options')) {
        echo do_shortcode('[show_cookie_content]');
        exit;
    }
});
```
